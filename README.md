# cadata

## Overview

**cadata** is a comprehensive data automation and reporting toolkit for Collegiate Academies. It automates daily, weekly, and on-demand data tasks for attendance, communication, reporting, and more. The project is designed to be modular, maintainable, and extensible for a variety of school data needs.

### How it Works

- Scheduled and manual scripts run to collect, process, and distribute data (attendance, letters, emails, reports, etc.)
- Scripts are organized by function in `src/` (core logic) and `triggers/` (school-specific or scheduled jobs)
- Configuration and credentials are managed via JSON files
- Output is delivered via email, SMS, or file exports
