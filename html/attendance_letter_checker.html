        Hi there!
    </p>
    <p>
        Attendance letters run between 5 AM and 6 AM every Monday that school is in session. Certain fields in PowerSchool are required to be filled out for attendance letters to go out for a student. Please refer to the list below for any students who might be missing data and update their information in PowerSchool before Monday.
